    "The goal of this lab session is to investigate the receivers for the PSS signals used 3GPP-NR systems. These are the most basic signals that a terminal must detect prior to initiating a connection with the basestation. This detection is the first step in the so-called cell search procedure.\n",
    "You are to hand-in a report answering all the questions outlined here along with corresponding code and figure files. If you do not finish in the supervised period of the session, you can continue to work on your own time."
